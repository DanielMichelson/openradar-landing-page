### What is this about?

- You don't want to pay license fees?
- You don't want to commit to a black box software?
- You are concerned about the PhD student that comes after you?
- You want to efficiently collaborate with people around the world?
- You want to stand on the shoulders of giants instead of reinventing the wheel?
- You don't care if it's free, you just want it to work?

If it's a **yes** to any of these questions, then have a closer look...
